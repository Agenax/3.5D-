# 3.5D-
A 3.5 dimension printer. Aims at printing pieces that couldn't be printed with classical 5 axis 3D printers. Aims also at cutting costs to make it abordable but still easy to build.

It uses yet :
- 2 harmonic drive nema17 stepper motors
- 40mm aluminium bars
- ball bearings
- prusa XL 90mm heating tile

Other parts will be 3d printed.

My model will soon include a first design of xyz axis and of the hotend.
I also made some static studies to calculate deformations and thus misalignment issues. The associated software will include compensations.
